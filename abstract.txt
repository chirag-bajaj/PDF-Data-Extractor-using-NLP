 n nWe present YOLO  a new approach to object detection  nPrior work on object detection repurposes classi xef xac x  ers to per  nform detection  Instead  we frame object detection as a re  ngression problem to spatially separated bounding boxes and nassociated class probabilities  A single neural network pre  ndicts bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from nfull images in one evaluation  Since the whole detection npipeline is a single network  it can be optimized end to end ndirectly on detection performance  n nOur uni xef xac x  ed architecture is extremely fast  Our base nYOLO model processes images in real time at    frames nper second  A smaller version of the network  Fast YOLO  nprocesses an astounding     frames per second while nstill achieving double the mAP of other real time detec  ntors  Compared to state of the art detection systems  YOLO nmakes more localization errors but is less likely to predict nfalse positives on background  Finally  YOLO learns very ngeneral representations of objects  It outperforms other de  ntection methods  including DPM and R CNN  when gener  nalizing from natural images to other domains like artwork  n n
